# IndexNow for Python ðŸ”Ž
## Why Use IndexNow for Python?
If you are concerned about search engine optimization (SEO) and want to make sure your website is indexed frequently by [Bing](https://www.bing.com/indexnow), [Yandex](https://yandex.com/indexnow), [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/), and other search engines, then IndexNow for Python may be the right choice for you.

IndexNow for Python is a lightweight, yet powerful Python package that makes it easy to submit URLs or entire sitemaps to the IndexNow API of various search engines, so your pages can be indexed faster.

!!! note "What is IndexNow?"
    [IndexNow](https://www.indexnow.org/) is an open source protocol that allows website owners to notify search engines when their content has changed, so that search engines can quickly crawl and index the new content. This is particularly useful for sites that update frequently or have dynamic content, and it is useful for search engines to know which pages to crawl and index since the last visit.

    By using IndexNow, you can ensure that your website is indexed more frequently, which can improve your search engine rankings and drive more traffic to your site.

    Search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/indexnow), [Yandex](https://yandex.com/indexnow), [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) (via Bing's index) and others already support IndexNow, but not all search engines. For example, Google is not on board, but this may change in the future.

## How It Works and Submitting URLs to a Search Engine
### Individual URL
Firstly, ensure that you have an [API key for IndexNow](https://www.indexnow.org/api-key). Hereafter, add your authentication credentials to the [`IndexNowAuthentication`](reference/configuration/authentication.md) class, which will be used throughout the examples:

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="3-7"
from index_now import submit_url_to_index_now, IndexNowAuthentication

authentication = IndexNowAuthentication(
    host="example.com",
    api_key="a1b2c3d4",
    api_key_location="https://example.com/a1b2c3d4.txt",
)
```

You can now submit individual URLs to the IndexNow API:

```python linenums="8" hl_lines="1" title=""
submit_url_to_index_now(authentication, "https://example.com/page1")
```

### Multiple URLs in Bulk
How to submit multiple URLs in bulk to the IndexNow API:

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="9-15"
from index_now import submit_urls_to_index_now, IndexNowAuthentication

authentication = IndexNowAuthentication(
    host="example.com",
    api_key="a1b2c3d4",
    api_key_location="https://example.com/a1b2c3d4.txt",
)

urls = [
    "https://example.com/page1",
    "https://example.com/page2",
    "https://example.com/page3",
]

submit_urls_to_index_now(authentication, urls)
```

### Entire Sitemap
How to submit an entire sitemap to the IndexNow API:

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="9-11"
from index_now import submit_sitemap_to_index_now, IndexNowAuthentication

authentication = IndexNowAuthentication(
    host="example.com",
    api_key="a1b2c3d4",
    api_key_location="https://example.com/a1b2c3d4.txt",
)

sitemap_location = "https://example.com/sitemap.xml"

submit_sitemap_to_index_now(authentication, sitemap_location)
```

### Submit to Different Search Engines
How to use the default [`SearchEngineEndpoint`](reference/configuration/endpoint.md) options or a custom endpoint:

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="9-10 12 14"
from index_now import submit_url_to_index_now, IndexNowAuthentication, SearchEngineEndpoint

authentication = IndexNowAuthentication(
    host="example.com",
    api_key="a1b2c3d4",
    api_key_location="https://example.com/a1b2c3d4.txt",
)

endpoint_bing = SearchEngineEndpoint.BING
endpoint_custom = "https://example.com/indexnow"

for endpoint in [endpoint_bing, endpoint_custom]:
    submit_url_to_index_now(authentication, "https://example.com/page1",
        endpoint)
```

!!! warning
    It is not recommended to submit the same URLs to multiple endpoints. Once you have successfully submitted to one [IndexNow](https://www.indexnow.org) endpoint, the IndexNow service is designed to propagate your URLs to other search engines, so you do not need to submit to multiple times.
